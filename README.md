This was my final project for CS370. We were supplied with starter code that set up the environment, and I was was responsible in creating code that will allow the agent to navigate the maze and find the treasure. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are responsible for developing software that is designed to solve everyday problems. The software computer scientists develop is used in our every day lives, and as technology continues to become more and more relevant day to day, computer scientists and the software they develop will be crucial. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem as a computer scientists, you have to first understand the problem you're trying to solve. Then you have to design a solution, having a plan of attack before development. Then, you implement your solution by writing code, testing frequently along the way. Finally, check your solution and ensure your code meets good coding practices. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As the developer, I am responsible with ensuring the user the software I develop will be ethically responsible and won't collect user data unless necessary. The data collected will also be private, and won't be shared to anyone else.
